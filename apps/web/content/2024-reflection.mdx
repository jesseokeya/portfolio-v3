As I look back, I feel an immense sense of gratitude for how far I’ve come, both professionally and personally. The year has been one of growth, challenges, and a constant drive toward improvement. Looking back, it’s easy to see that while there were hurdles along the way, each one has contributed to shaping the person I am today. I’m thankful for every lesson learned, every connection made, and every project completed.

### Personal and Professional Growth

This year has been a turning point in many ways. Professionally, I’ve gained a broader understanding of my craft, pushing myself to not only improve my technical skills but also my ability to **collaborate**, **lead**, and **communicate** effectively with others. Personal growth has been equally important, as I’ve learned to manage my time better, set clearer boundaries, and make space for both work and personal well-being.

The biggest realization I’ve had is the importance of **balance**. While ambition is crucial, finding joy in the present moment is just as important. Sometimes, I can be my toughest critic, always pushing for the next milestone, but 2024 has taught me to slow down and appreciate how far I’ve come. It’s been a year of learning to celebrate progress, no matter how small.

### Building chyro.io

One of the most exciting projects I’ve worked on this year is [**chyro.io**](https://chyro.io), an all-in-one management solution for chiropractic practices, covering everything from patient care to billing. I’m excited about its potential, especially since we already have over 20 clinics on a waitlist. We’re planning to launch in **Houston in April next year**, and I’m confident it will be a game changer.

What makes [**chyro.io**](https://chyro.io) even more special to me is that it’s not just a product for others—it’s something that directly **helps my mom** manage the administrative challenges she faces with her own chiropractic practice. Watching her struggle with cumbersome processes was a big motivation for me to create a solution that would simplify things for chiropractors everywhere.

I see **huge potential** for [**chyro.io**](https://chyro.io) to grow beyond just chiropractic clinics. There are so many other types of practices that could benefit from this kind of streamlined solution, and I’m excited about what the future holds for this project. The journey is just beginning, and I can’t wait to see it take off.

### Moving Forward in 2025

As I look ahead to 2025, I want to shift gears and be even more **proactive** in chasing and building the ideas and projects I’m passionate about. Too often, great ideas slip away because they’re not acted on quickly enough. My goal for the upcoming year is to **act immediately** on the problems I want to solve, not just letting them linger as possibilities but transforming them into reality.

This means **taking more risks**, experimenting more, and not being afraid to fail. I want to surround myself with more **like-minded entrepreneurs**, people who are not only building great products but who are passionate about **solving real problems** in meaningful ways. By placing myself in the right environments, I can grow faster, learn more, and be inspired by those around me.

The world of software engineering is changing at a rapid pace, and the rise of **AI** is reshaping everything we know. We don’t know what the upper bounds of AI’s capabilities are yet, but one thing is certain—it’s here to stay and will continue to evolve. Rather than being intimidated by the uncertainty, I see this as a huge opportunity. Those who are adaptable and embrace the change will thrive.

In this new landscape, **learning how to market yourself** and position your skills is becoming increasingly important. Whether it’s through personal branding, networking, or simply showing up in the right spaces, positioning yourself as a problem-solver with a growth mindset will open doors. It’s not just about knowing the latest tools or technologies—it’s about having the ability to **adapt** and continuously learn in a world that is constantly changing.

### A New Chapter: Moving to Houston

On a personal note, 2024 also marks the beginning of a significant new chapter in my life. After years in Ottawa, I’m excited to announce that I’m **moving to Houston** in 2025. This move represents more than just a change in location—it’s a chance for a fresh start, new opportunities, and new challenges. I’m eager to dive into the Houston tech and entrepreneurial scene and see where this next phase of my life takes me.

This move also brings the excitement of stepping out of my comfort zone, into a new city with new people and new possibilities. The change will no doubt come with its challenges, but I’m ready for them. Sometimes, growth requires stepping into the unknown, and this move feels like exactly that—a step into something bigger, something new, and something exciting.

### Looking Ahead to 2025

I can’t predict exactly what 2025 will bring, but I can say with certainty that I’m more excited than ever for the future. I plan to **stay curious**, to continue learning and improving, and to keep pushing myself toward my goals. Whether it’s through building new products, solving challenging problems, or simply learning as much as I can, 2025 feels like a year of boundless potential.

As I close the chapter on 2024, I feel a deep sense of accomplishment for everything I’ve been able to achieve, but I also recognize that there is still so much more to do. The future is bright, and I’m excited to continue on this journey, wherever it may lead.

Here’s to **new beginnings**, continued growth, and all the exciting opportunities that 2025 will bring.
