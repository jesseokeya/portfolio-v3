Building a startup in 2024 means having access to incredible tools that would have required entire teams to build just a few years ago. At [AskBenny](https://askbenny.ca/), we've carefully selected each piece of our tech stack to maximize our small team's impact. Here's what we chose and why.

## The Philosophy: Build vs. Buy vs. Integrate

Our approach is simple:

- **Build** what makes us unique (our AI answering service)
- **Buy** solved problems (analytics, chat, infrastructure)
- **Integrate** everything seamlessly

This lets us focus our engineering effort where it matters most.

## Analytics: PostHog – Understanding Without Invading

We chose PostHog for a critical reason: we need to understand how users interact with [AskBenny](https://askbenny.ca/) without compromising their privacy.

### What PostHog Gives Us:

**Product Analytics**

- User flows: How do businesses set up their AI receptionist?
- Feature adoption: Which features drive retention?
- Drop-off points: Where do users get stuck?

**Session Recordings**

- Watch real users navigate our platform
- Identify UX issues before customers complain
- Understand the "why" behind the numbers

**Feature Flags**

- Roll out new features gradually
- A/B test with real users
- Instant rollback if something breaks

**Surveys**

- In-app feedback at the right moment
- NPS scores to track satisfaction
- Qualitative insights to complement quantitative data

The killer feature? Everything runs on our infrastructure. Customer data never leaves our control.

## Customer Communication: Crisp – More Than Just Chat

For a lean team, customer communication can't be an afterthought. Crisp became our command center for customer relationships.

### Why Crisp Works for Us:

**Unified Inbox**

- Chat, email, and social media in one place
- Jordan manages all customer touchpoints efficiently
- No context switching between platforms

**Automation with a Human Touch**

- Smart routing based on customer type
- Automated responses for common questions
- But always with the option for human intervention

**Knowledge Base Integration**

- Customers self-serve for simple questions
- Reduces support load without sacrificing quality
- SEO benefits as a bonus

**Real-Time Collaboration**

- I can jump into technical conversations instantly
- Sydney sees customer feedback for ad optimization
- Jordan maintains relationship continuity

## Infrastructure: SST + AWS – Fully Serverless, Event-Driven, Beautiful

We went all-in on serverless with SST.dev as our infrastructure-as-code framework. This decision transformed how we build and deploy.

### Why SST Changed Everything

SST isn't just another IaC tool – it's designed specifically for serverless applications:

- **Live Lambda Development**: Debug Lambda functions locally with breakpoints
- **Type-Safe Infrastructure**: Our infrastructure and code share types
- **Zero-Config Deploys**: Git push → Production with built-in CI/CD

### Our Serverless Stack:

**Database: DynamoDB with Stream Triggers**

- Single-table design for all our entities
- DynamoDB Streams trigger dependent updates automatically
- Pay-per-request pricing aligns with our growth
- Instant scaling from 0 to millions of requests

**Message Queue: SQS**

- Decouple our services for reliability
- Handle call processing asynchronously
- Built-in retry logic and dead letter queues
- Perfect for our event-driven architecture

**Compute: Lambda Functions**

- No servers to manage or patch
- Automatic scaling based on demand
- Pay only for actual execution time
- Cold starts optimized with proper bundling

**Storage: S3**

- Call recordings stored securely
- Automatic lifecycle policies for cost optimization
- CloudFront CDN for global distribution
- Event triggers for processing pipelines

## Event-Driven Architecture: Mimicking the Real World

Our system models real-world interactions through events:

### How Events Flow Through [AskBenny](https://askbenny.ca/)

```mermaid
graph TD
    Call[Incoming Call] --> Event[CallReceived Event]
    Event --> Lambda[Lambda Handler]
    Lambda --> Record[Customer Record Update]
    Record --> Stream[DynamoDB Stream]
    
    Stream --> Analytics[Update Analytics]
    Stream --> Notify[Notify Team]
    Stream --> Trigger[Trigger Follow-up]
```

This architecture means:

- **Every action has a traceable event**
- **Systems stay loosely coupled**
- **Failures are isolated and retryable**
- **Real-world processes map directly to code**

### Example: When a Call Completes

1. Lambda processes the call → publishes `CallCompleted` event to SQS
2. DynamoDB updates customer record → triggers stream event
3. Stream processor updates analytics, sends notifications
4. All happening asynchronously, all retryable, all scalable

## Monitoring: CloudWatch + SST Console

Observability is crucial when running serverless:

### SST Console: Our Mission Control

The SST Console gives us:

- **Real-time function logs** across all services
- **Live tail of DynamoDB operations**
- **Visual event flow tracking**
- **One-click access to any resource**

### CloudWatch: Deep Insights

We've set up:

- **Custom metrics** for business KPIs (calls answered, average duration)
- **Alarms** for anomaly detection (spike in failed calls)
- **Dashboards** combining technical and business metrics
- **Log Insights** queries for debugging specific issues

### The Power of Infrastructure as Code

With SST, our entire infrastructure is:

```typescript
new Table(stack, "Customers", {
  stream: "new_and_old_images",
  consumers: {
    analytics: "functions/analytics.handler",
    notifications: "functions/notify.handler",
  },
});
```

Type-safe, version-controlled, and reviewable like any other code.

## The Glue: Modern Development Tools

Beyond the big three, several tools keep everything running smoothly:

**Deployment: SST on AWS**

- Single command deployment: `sst deploy`
- Infrastructure and application code deploy together
- Staging environments for testing changes
- Instant rollbacks with CloudFormation
- Type-safe deployments catch errors at build time

**Domain Management: Cloudflare**

- DNS managed through Cloudflare for reliability
- SSL certificates automatically provisioned
- DDoS protection and CDN included
- API for programmatic DNS updates

**Monitoring: Sentry**

- Catch errors before customers report them
- Performance monitoring to maintain speed
- Integrates with our development workflow

**Communication: Linear + Discord**

- Linear for task tracking (minimal overhead)
- Discord for real-time communication
- GitHub for code collaboration

## Cost Breakdown: Pay for What You Use

Our serverless architecture means costs scale perfectly with usage:

- **PostHog**: Self-hosted on our infrastructure
- **Crisp**: $95/month for team features
- **AWS Serverless**: ~$300/month currently
  - DynamoDB: $0 for first 25GB + pay-per-request
  - Lambda: First 1M requests free monthly
  - SQS: $0 for first 1M requests
  - Only paying for actual usage, not idle resources
- **Other tools**: ~$100/month combined

The beauty of serverless: our infrastructure costs were almost nothing during development and now scale linearly with revenue.

## Integration Magic: Making It All Work Together

The real power comes from integration:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Customer Action] --> B[PostHog Event]
    B --> C[Crisp Message]
    C --> D[Team Notification]
```

Example flow:

1. New customer signs up (PostHog tracks)
2. Crisp automatically sends onboarding message
3. Jordan gets notification for personal follow-up
4. Sydney sees high-value lead alert
5. I monitor technical onboarding success

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Start Simple, Upgrade When Needed

We began with free tiers and upgraded only when limits became constraints.

### 2. Prioritize Developer Experience

Tools that slow us down get cut, no matter how feature-rich.

### 3. Data Privacy Matters

Choosing tools that respect customer privacy builds trust and ensures compliance.

### 4. Integration > Features

A tool that integrates well beats a feature-rich island every time.

## What We'd Do Differently

If starting today, we'd:

- Start with SST from day one (we migrated after a few weeks)
- Design for events first, not add them later
- Set up structured logging immediately
- Use DynamoDB single-table design from the beginning

## The Future Stack

As we scale, we're evaluating:

- **EventBridge** for more complex event routing
- **Step Functions** for multi-step workflows
- **Kinesis** for real-time streaming analytics
- **AppSync** for real-time customer dashboards

The serverless ecosystem keeps improving, and we're positioned to adopt new services as they mature.
