I'm writing this update because things at [AskBenny](https://askbenny.ca/) have been moving at a pace I can only describe as crazy.

We are seeing incredible growth, and looking at the numbers today, it's clear that we've hit an inflection point. We are now one of the largest platforms on our underlying voice agent infrastructure, which has given us a massive advantage in terms of cost savings. These improved unit economics have directly contributed to our bottom line, making AskBenny **profitable**.

Achieving profitability is a huge milestone for any startup, but doing it this quickly, and with a team of just three people, feels insane.

## The Power of a Lean Team

It's just me, Jordan, and Sydney.

Building a profitable, high-growth company with such a lean team is a testament to how much leverage you can get today with the right tools and the right people. It doesn't feel like "work" in the traditional sense. We are learning every single day, supporting our customers, and working hard as hell, but it is all incredibly fulfilling.

I really enjoy working with my co-founders. We're in the trenches together, and there's a unique energy that comes from a small team executing at a high level.

## Finding Our Standout Niche: Medical

One of the most exciting developments is a clear signal we're seeing from the market. We have stumbled into a standout niche: **the medical space**.

It looks like we might double down on this and potentially create a dedicated vertical just to serve this niche. The pain point is real and visceral. Medical practices struggle with integrating into their EMRs (Electronic Medical Records) and efficiently booking appointments for patients with the appropriate doctors.

AskBenny is solving this. We're helping practices automate their intake and scheduling in a way that feels natural and human, but with the efficiency of AI.

## Fundraising and The Future

We are currently in talks with some major VCs and companies regarding fundraising, and we're hoping to close our round soon. This capital will help us fuel this fire and expand our reach, especially in the medical vertical.

I am so excited about next year. Honestly, we are just getting started.

## Take the Bet

This is, without a doubt, the most fulfilling work I've done in my career so far.

If I've learned one thing from this journey, it's this: **Take a bet on yourself and go all in.**

We did, and it's paying off in ways we couldn't have imagined.

_Stay tuned for more updates as we close our round and dive deeper into the medical space._
