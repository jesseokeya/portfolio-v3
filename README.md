# Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio website, [jesseokeya.com](https://jesseokeya.com) â€” a space where I showcase my work, ideas, blog posts, and various side projects. Built with Next.js, this app lives under `apps/web` and is deployed using [SST](https://sst.dev), leveraging AWS for serverless infrastructure and Cloudflare for domain management.

## Features

- **Portfolio**: A comprehensive showcase of my professional work, projects, and accomplishments.
- **Blog**: Posts where I share my thoughts on software engineering, product development, and more.
- **Playground**: A place for my experimental ideas, side projects, and creative coding.

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org)
- **Infrastructure**: [SST](https://sst.dev) for deploying to AWS serverless environment.
- **Domain Management**: [Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com)
- **Backend Services**: AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, and API Gateway for serverless computing.
